# Reflections from working in a team ‚úç
- I joined a group of volunteers (3 active developers) on a project at Global Recording Networks (GRN)
- I've never worked with a team before and am currently picking up a few things that I want to record
for my own future review

## Learning `git` within a team
- Before joining the team, I only knew how to commit straight to `master` which I know is a frowned upon practice.
- Starting this role, I had to learn how to write code in a way that other people can contribute to.
	- This meant making a new branch with certain naming conventions.
`git branch -b "kndwin-testLog4js"`
	- And pushing this local branch to the remote repo.
`git push -u origin "kndwin-testLog4js"`
- It wasn't too daunting thought, it seems my pains with `git` in my personal projects meant I'm more comfortable playing around with üôÇ

## Research before writing code
- Normally I don't document my code since I think my commit coments might be enough, but now that I'm working in a group. I've been more aware of documentation and having things written down.

## Communication and code review
- This something that I'm worried about, I've never had my code reviewed before so I'm not sure if there's any conventions I might be breaking. But I know the purpose of code review is to help me be a better programmer so I'll try to not shy away from it.

It's been quite a good learning experience so far and hoping to help out more!
